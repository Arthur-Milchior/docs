The Explanation Article (Use Title Case)
========================================

Explanation or Discussion articles explain background information and
provide context-specific knowledge on a particular topic. **The goals of
an explanation article is to help readers to understand a topic**, not
to teach concepts or provide steps in a task.

Explanation articles work well if they:

-  Give context to a subject or topic that your readers might not have.
-  Explain the background about a topic that might not be evident in
   Reference or How-To articles.
-  Suggest alternative approaches or different ways of thinking about a
   use case or technical problem.
-  Help readers make connections between related concepts, and form a
   better understanding of the subject.

Content of your explanation article
-----------------------------------

Contrary to Titles, Section headers use sentence case

The overview section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summarize what the reader will achieve by reading the explanation
article.

-  Are you writing for developers or managers?
-  Are you writing for people who have a certain problem to solve?
-  Are you writing for a particular industry or market segment?

Structuring explanation articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Structure explanation topics as you would to a group who doesn’t know
anything about your chosen subject. Your explanation should introduce
ideas gradually, so your audience can grow their understanding of the
concepts it covers.

It can be easy to blend explanations with other types of content, like
How-To or Reference articles. Some tips to avoid mixing documentation
types:

-  Avoid instructions, procedures, or any content that doesn’t focus
   solely on building upon the conceptual understanding of the
   explanation topic.
-  If you find yourself writing steps or describing how to do something
   in detail in your explanation article, you need to shift your focus
   away from describing the tasks, and go back to the concept. Remind
   yourself of the main goals of your article.

Here are some clues that your explanation article is not staying
on-topic.

| Clue            | Solution                                           |
+=================+====================================================+
| You write steps | Look for opportunities to link to other topics     |
| to achieve      | that complement your explanation content. Link to  |
| something that  | these articles in-line or at the end of the        |
| you’re          | document in the “Where to next” section.           |
| describing in   |                                                    |
| your topic.     |                                                    |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| You want to     | Link to the video in the “Where to next” section   |
| insert a        | instead, so your audience doesn’t get distracted   |
| tutorial video  | by the video.                                      |
| directly into   |                                                    |
| the article.    |                                                    |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| You include     | You are mixing too much reference content into     |
| YAML and JSON   | your explanation article. Bring the focus back to  |
| structures of   | understanding the structures, not documenting      |
| end-points.     | everything you can do with them. If your           |
|                 | explanation article still needs to link back to    |
|                 | the API, you can add the link with a brief         |
|                 | explanation to the Related Articles section.       |
