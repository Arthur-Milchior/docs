# Documentation Process

All documentation should follow the same process as any other PR:

1. Developer who wrote the code should also write the Documentation.
2. Documentation engineer will review the PR.
3. After PR is approved by Doc-engineer it will be reviewed/edited by technical writer
4. It will be reviewed once more and approved by Doc-engineer.

## How-to

1. Read [Documentation Style Guide](https://github.com/jina-ai/docs/blob/master/page_templates/style_guide.md): This is the first step to make. Here you will find a specific guide with tips on how-to write.
2. Use the templates we have: We want to have an uniform structure in all of our docs, and we provide two templates for you to use. One for [How-to Documentation](https://github.com/jina-ai/docs/blob/master/page_templates/developer_guide_how_to.rst) and one for [explanatory articles](https://github.com/jina-ai/docs/blob/master/page_templates/developer_guide_explanation.md). Use the first for concrete guidelines. For whatever topic that will be better explained step-by-step. And use the second to explain theory and background.
 Feel free to expand from it and add more sections, but make sure it has at least the ones suggested. 
3. Use a Spell checker: Although the document will be reviewed by a tech-writer, use a grammar checker before submitting to speed up the process. You can use one directly in [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/spellchecking.html#configure-the-typo-inspection) and [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EWoodruff.VisualStudioSpellCheckerVS2017andLater). Or any other tool as [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/)
