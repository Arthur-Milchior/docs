Requirements
====================

The first thing you should take care of are the requirements. Create a **requirements.txt**. In this file you will specify required dependencies you'll need. Write a module per line. You can then install all the packages with pip like this:

.. highlight:: bash
.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt
